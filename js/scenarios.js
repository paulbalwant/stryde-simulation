This morning, you received an email from your key supplier in Vietnam indicating a 3-week delay in delivery of the sustainable materials due to unexpected quality control issues.

This delay threatens:
- Product launch timeline
- Marketing campaign coordination
- Retail partner commitments
- Team morale and workload

Your team members are waiting for your response:
- Dr. Keisha Ramdial (R&D) is concerned about product testing time
- Andre Baptiste (Marketing) has media commitments scheduled
- Malik Joseph (Operations) needs to coordinate with logistics
- Sadie Persad (HR) is worried about team stress levels
- Tristen Thompson (Finance) is concerned about budget impacts

Write an email to your team addressing this situation.`,

Dr. Keisha Ramdial has been working 12-hour days trying to compress the testing timeline. Andre Baptiste seems frustrated in meetings. Malik Joseph has been short-tempered with his team.

Option A: Launch on schedule with limited inventory (60% of planned stock)
- Pros: Meet commitments, maintain momentum, test market response
- Cons: Risk stockouts, potential customer disappointment, team exhausted

Option B: Delay launch by 3 weeks to ensure full inventory
- Pros: Full preparation, team recovery time, quality assurance
- Cons: Break commitments, lose media coverage, competitor advantage

Your team is divided. Andre (Marketing) wants Option A. Keisha (R&D) wants Option B. The others are uncertain.
